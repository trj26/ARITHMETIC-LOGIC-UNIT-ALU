SIMULATION REPORT FOR DESIGNING ALU OPERATIONS

Abstract:

This report outlines the design, simulation, and verification of an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) supporting addition, subtraction, and logical operations. The goal is to implement an efficient and modular ALU that meets predefined performance and functional requirements. This document details the methodology, simulation results, and analysis to ensure robust ALU functionality.

1. INTRODUCTION:

An Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a fundamental building block in digital systems, responsible for executing arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU designed in this project supports the following operations:

Arithmetic: Addition, Subtraction

Logical: AND, OR, XOR, NOT

2. DESIGN DESCRIPTION

1) Architecture

The ALU consists of the following components:

Input Registers: Store operands (A and B) and control signals.

Operation Decoder: Decodes the operation selection signal.

Arithmetic Block:

Addition using ripple carry adder.

Subtraction implemented using two’s complement addition.

Logical Block:

Implements bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations.

Output Register: Stores the result and status flags (Zero, Carry, Overflow).

2) Control Signals:

Opcode: 3-bit signal to select the operation.

Enable: Activates the ALU.

3)Status Flags

Zero (Z): Indicates if the result is zero.

Carry (C): Indicates a carry out of the most significant bit.

Overflow (V): Detects signed overflow.

3.SIMULATION SETUP:

1) Environment

Software: ModelSim/QuestaSim for VHDL/Verilog simulations.

Testbench: Designed to validate each operation with diverse test cases.

Clock Signal: Used for synchronous operation.

2) Test Cases

A) Addition:

Positive + Positive

Positive + Negative

Overflow cases

B) Subtraction:

Positive – Positive

Negative – Positive

Borrow detection

C) Logical Operations:
 
A AND B

A OR B

A XOR B

NOT A

4. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS:

1) Simulation Outputs

Case 1: Addition

Input: A = 5, B = 3, OpCode = 000 (Addition)

Output: Result = 8, Carry = 0, Overflow = 0

Case 2: Subtraction

Input: A = 5, B = 7, OpCode = 001 (Subtraction)

Output: Result = -2 (Two’s Complement), Borrow = 1, Overflow = 0

Case 3: Logical AND

Input: A = 1010, B = 1100, OpCode = 010

Output: Result = 1000

2) Performance Metrics

Propagation Delay:

Addition: 10 ns

Subtraction: 12 ns

Logical Operations: 5 ns

Power Consumption: Measured using synthesized netlist for 65 nm technology node.

5. DISCUSSION:

Correctness: All operations passed the functional verification tests.

Efficiency: The ripple carry adder showed increased delay for large bit widths. Optimizations like carry-lookahead adders may improve performance.

Modularity: The design is scalable for additional operations like multiplication or division.

6. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK:

The ALU design successfully meets the functional requirements for basic arithmetic and logical operations. Future enhancements could include:

Implementation of advanced arithmetic operations (e.g., multiplication, division).

Optimization of the adder for reduced delay.

Integration into a complete CPU pipeline.
